      Hi! I’m Noor, a third-year at Rutgers–Newark majoring in Graphic Design with a minor in Art History. Growing up surrounded by free-for-all art, I found comfort in the structure that design offers. I’m drawn to the small details, the idea that even the tiniest thread in a tapestry can play a vital role in the whole. Every weave, every thread, has a purpose.
      <br><br>
      As a designer, I’m intentional about using my platform to amplify voices that often go unheard, creating work that resonates with audiences who might otherwise look away.
      <br><br>
      Always in search of a new thread to add to my tapestry!
